# Streamlit-App-to-Predict-Customer-Churn
This is my first attempt to generate an application using Streamlit. This application checks different classifiers and displays interactively their respective accuracies in predicting customer churn.

Do note that you have to adjust the file path and name accordingly for the python script to run without error. You can find the data set on my github repository "Applied-Data-Science."

The application interface looks something like this:
